### Important JavaScript Concepts
This README covers some of the important concepts in JavaScript that every developer should know.

<details>
  <summary>1. Event Loop</summary>
  <p>
    In JavaScript, the event loop is responsible for handling all the asynchronous code that runs in the browser. It continuously checks for any asynchronous tasks in the event queue and executes them one by one in the order they were added. This helps prevent any blocking code from affecting the performance of the web page.
  </p>

<details>
  <summary>2. Web Storage APIs</summary>
  <p>
    Local Storage and Session Storage are two web storage APIs provided by modern browsers that allow you to store data on the client-side. Local Storage is used to store data that needs to be persisted across multiple sessions, while Session Storage is used to store data that needs to be retained only for the current session.
  </p>

<details>
  <summary>3. Hoisting in JS</summary>
  <p>
    Hoisting is a JavaScript behavior that allows variables and functions to be declared after they are used. When JavaScript code is executed, the variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their respective scopes.
  </p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>4. Diff in let, var, const</summary>
  <p>
    let and const are block-scoped variables introduced in ES6, while var is function-scoped. let variables can be reassigned, but not re-declared, while const variables cannot be reassigned or re-declared.
  </p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>5. IIFE function in JS</summary>
  <p>
    IIFE stands for Immediately Invoked Function Expression. It is a JavaScript function that is immediately executed as soon as it is defined. It is often used to create a private scope and prevent the pollution of the global namespace.
  </p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>6. First class function</summary>
  <p>
    In JavaScript, functions are treated as first-class citizens, which means they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned as values from functions.
  </p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>7. Promise in JS</summary>
  <p>
    A promise is an object in JavaScript that represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. It provides a way to handle asynchronous code in a more synchronous way, using a then() method to chain multiple asynchronous operations.
  </p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>8. Way of handling Promise</summary>
  <p>
    Promises can be handled using the then() and catch() methods. The then() method is used to handle the successful completion of a Promise, while the catch() method is used to handle any errors that may occur.
  </p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>9. Diff in async/await & Promise</summary>
  <p>
    async/await is a syntactical feature introduced in ES8 that makes working with Promises easier. It allows you to write asynchronous code in a synchronous style, making it easier to read and write. async/await uses Promises internally.
  </p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>10. Callbacks functions</summary>
  <p>
    A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed inside that function. It is often used to handle asynchronous code, where the callback function is executed when the asynchronous operation is complete.
  </p>
